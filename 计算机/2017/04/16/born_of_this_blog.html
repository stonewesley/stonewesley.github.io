<h4 id="used-have-one">Used have one</h4>
<p>I’ve aleady have a blog in sina. I’ve wrote many blogs here since going to college. Most of them focus on computer science(my major), guitar(my hobby), and my life. After graduating, I spent less time on it, but what in it helps me finding a job. I write the link down in my resume, and feel proud of having it.</p>
<h4 id="got-new-one">Got new one</h4>
<p>As long as I’m working now, challenges on my work should be recored, and the sina blog seems a little unprofessional to a programmer. So I look around and try to find sth more fit, and luckly I got github pages. Free storage, self-defined second level domain name and totally no-comment static web pages fulfills all my needs for a blog.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-get-it-done">How to get it done</h4>
<p>I seldom write javascript or css. It’s hard to write all pages by myself. So first, I have jekyll to do most of the job, and all I have to do is picking a jekyll theme and move my blogs here. After going through blogs show on Zhihu and thems on jekyll themes, I cannot find a desired theme, so I decided to write my own theme, and it should be different to normal type.</p>
<h4 id="my-own-theme">My own theme</h4>
<p>99% time of my work is spent under terminal, so I was wondering if I could have a blog look like a console, and here is it, a theme named console by me. It looks like you’re opening a terminal, and all you can do is type some command and see what will happen. Most of elements except pictures in post here is text because console only has it.</p>
<h4 id="having-fun-here">Having fun here</h4>
<p>I don’t give a hint at first, because I want everyone here have fun, exploring by themselves. When people don’t know what to do in a terminal(a REPL environment), or cannot figure out how to use a command, they ask help by typing <code class="highlighter-rouge">some-command --help</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">help(some command)</code> or others. Eventually, <code class="highlighter-rouge">help</code> is a keyword under this circumstances. <code class="highlighter-rouge">help</code> command will show a list of command supported here, but not all of them. The rest unrevealed do nothing help for looking posts. I set them up for surprise.</p>
<h4 id="the-background-music">The background music</h4>
<p>Actually, I’ve never thought to have bgm here, because it’s wired to listen to music in a console. But bgm is almost in every blog and I usually work while listening to music. So I learned how to use html5 features about audio and made a playlist here, and also wrote a corresponding set of command to control the bgm. My sister does’nt like what’s in the playlist, but I think they are funny. I should probably remove the <code class="highlighter-rouge">pause</code> command and you just live with that.</p>
<h4 id="the-great-fire-wall">The Great Fire Wall</h4>
<p>I developed this blog through a vpn, so I did’nt find the problem that music stored in github’s server cannot be loaded in the wall. Iframe or flash plugin are all I can find to use in the wall, but I still don’t want to have any gui component in my blog. Fortunately, I found external link on netease music. They use chinanetcenter cdn and have anti-stealing-link.</p>
